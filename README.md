# How many days until Boxing Day?

You can use this small JavaScript program to calculate how many days are left until Boxing Day.

## How does it work?

Just set the date of Boxing Day in the .js file (const boxingDayDate). The Boxing Day date is different in many countries. Then open the web developer console in your web browser and check the result. 

## What is the goal of this project? 
Just for fun :smiley: and practice coding :muscle:
